 * Challenge: Add the ability for the user to choose a new username
 * 
 * 1. Add state to this component to hold the new username in a controlled form
 * (https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
 * (https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/cW8Jdfy)
 * 
 * 2. Change userContext into a component that has state and provides the ability
 * to change the user's username. Make sure to export the provider and consumer
 * as named exports and update their uses anywhere else in the app
 * 
 * 3. Give this App component the ability to update the username in context when the
 * button is clicked
