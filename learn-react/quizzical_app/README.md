# Quizzical quiz app

Based on the [Scrimba "Learn React"](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) final project but developed from scratch.

# TODO

- Fix issue where Confetti only covers the portion of screen that's visible when it triggers
  - Maybe means rendering it from main.jsx instead of Quiz.jsx
- Fix issue with the "Check Answer" button appearing momentarily before the questions render
- Write tests/jest
  - Dummy data for testing win condition, to avoid needing to console log the correct answer
- Get rid of hard-coded 5 question limit and allow choosing a variable number of questions
