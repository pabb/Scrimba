# Scrimba Projects

Projects for Scrimba.com's online React courses, which I worked on from July to September 2022:

- [Intermediate React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)
- [Advanced React](https://scrimba.com/learn/react) 

# Dependencies

Most projects were created with NodeJS version 16.5 and bootstrapped with `ViteJS` version 3, though some early projects used `create-react-app`.
